type AdultAssumptions
  """
    Age specific survivorship (survivorship at carrying capacity if density depedence occurs)
    Age at 50% mature (Binomial cdf assumed)
    Age specific fecundity (i.e. mean quantity of eggs each spawning female will produce)
    Compensatory fecundity - compensatory strength for changes in fecundity. Compensatory strength
      is a divisor of K which will result in a 68% change in fecundity - smaller values indicate
      lower compensation strength. Compensation function based on Normal CDF. Use NaN if compensation
      is assumed to not occur.
    Compensatory sexual maturity - compensatory strength for changes in age of sexual maturity.
      Compensatory strength is a divisor of K which will result in a 68% change in age of sexual
      maturity - smaller values indicate lower compensation strength. Compensation function based on
      Normal CDF. Use NaN if compensation is assumed to not occur.
    Compensatory mortality - compensatory strength for changes in age of sexual maturity. Compensatory
      strength is a divisor of K which will result in a 68% change in natural mortality - smaller
      values indicate lower compensation strength. Compensation function based on Normal CDF. Use NaN
      if compensation is assumed to not occur.
